## Project Overview

Ignited was designed from the beginning to be modular, and for that reason each "Delta Core" has its own GitHub repo and is added as a submodule to the main Ignited project. Additionally, Ignited uses two of [Riley Testut](https://github.com/rileytestut)'s private frameworks to share common functionality between apps: Roxas and Harmony.

[**Ignited**](https://github.com/LitRitt/Ignited)  
Ignited is just a regular, sandboxed iOS application. The Ignited app repo (aka this one) contains all the code specific to the Ignited app itself, such as storyboards, app-specific view controllers, database logic, etc.

[**DeltaCore**](https://github.com/LitRitt/DeltaCore)  
DeltaCore serves as the ‚Äúmiddle-man‚Äù between the high-level app code and the specific emulation cores. By working with this framework, you have access to all the core Ignited features, such as emulation, controller skins, save states, cheat codes, etc. Other potential emulator apps will use this framework extensively.

[**Roxas**](https://github.com/LitRitt/Roxas)    
Roxas is [Riley Testut](https://github.com/rileytestut)'s framework used across his projects, developed to simplify a variety of common tasks used in iOS development.

[**Harmony**](https://github.com/LitRitt/Harmony)   
Harmony is [Riley Testut](https://github.com/rileytestut)'s personal syncing framework designed to sync Core Data databases. Harmony listens for changes to an app's persistent store, then syncs any changes with a remote file service (such as Google Drive or Dropbox).

**Delta Cores**
Each system in Ignited is implemented as its own "Delta Core", which serves as a standard emulation API Ignited can understand regardless of the underlying core. For the most part, you don't interact directly with specific Delta Cores, but rather indirectly through `DeltaCore`.
